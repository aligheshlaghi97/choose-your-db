DynamoDB is a fully managed, distributed key-value and document NoSQL database provided by AWS. It is built for low-latency, internet-scale applications and is known for its predictable performance at any scale.  The data model is based on tables with simple or composite primary keys, and it supports both eventually consistent and strongly consistent reads, giving developers control over the trade-off between speed and data freshness. In terms of the CAP theorem, DynamoDB is a quintessential AP system, prioritizing high availability and partition tolerance. It is designed to be always available, even during network partitions or node failures, and uses asynchronous replication across multiple availability zones to achieve this. This design makes it a perfect fit for applications that demand immense horizontal scalability and guaranteed uptime, such as gaming leaderboards, user session stores, and IoT data collection.

PostgreSQL is a robust, open-source relational database celebrated for its strong ACID compliance and adherence to SQL standards. It uses a row-based storage model that efficiently handles Online Transaction Processing (OLTP) workloads by keeping a record's entire data together. Its extensibility is a core design principle, allowing it to support not only traditional structured data but also modern, semi-structured formats like JSONB and custom data types.  This makes it a hybrid database capable of handling both relational and document-style workloads. A single PostgreSQL server typically operates as a CA (Consistency, Availability) system. In a replicated setup, it prioritizes consistency, making it a CP system. This means it guarantees all clients see the same, most recent data, but may sacrifice availability if a network partition occurs and the primary node cannot be reached. Its built-in Full-Text Search (FTS) and advanced indexing further enhance its versatility for a wide range of applications that demand data integrity and rich functionality.

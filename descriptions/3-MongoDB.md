MongoDB is a popular document-oriented NoSQL database that stores data as flexible, JSON-like (BSON) documents. Its dynamic schema allows for rapid development and iteration, as documents within the same collection can have different fields.  The document model is intuitive for developers and helps avoid complex joins by nesting related data within a single document. MongoDB is a horizontally scalable database with native support for sharding and replication sets, which provide high availability and load distribution. In the context of the CAP theorem, MongoDB is generally considered an AP system, prioritizing availability and partition tolerance over strong consistency. However, it offers tunable consistency through configurable read and write concerns, allowing developers to choose stronger guarantees when needed. This flexibility makes it a powerful choice for modern web and mobile applications that require high availability, scalability, and the ability to handle evolving data structures.

HBase is a distributed, column-oriented NoSQL database designed for massive, sparse datasets. Modeled after Google's Bigtable, it is built on top of the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS), providing real-time random read/write access to petabytes of data (not good choice for small gigabytes/terabytes of data).  Its data model is based on column families, which allows for a flexible schema and efficient storage of sparse tables with millions of columns and billions of rows. HBase is a write-optimized system, leveraging a Write-Ahead Log (WAL) for durability and an in-memory store (MemStore) for speed. From a CAP theorem perspective, HBase is a CP system, prioritizing consistency and partition tolerance. In the event of a network partition, it will sacrifice availability to prevent data inconsistencies or splits, ensuring all readers have a consistent view of the data. This design makes it a top choice for append-heavy workloads like time-series data, sensor logs, and other big data applications that require strong horizontal scalability and high write throughput.

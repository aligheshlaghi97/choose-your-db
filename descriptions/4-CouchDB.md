CouchDB is a unique document-oriented NoSQL database with a strong focus on replication and a RESTful HTTP API. Its defining feature is multi-master asynchronous replication, allowing databases to sync seamlessly across different devices, even over an unreliable network. This makes it ideal for building offline-first applications.  Data is stored as JSON documents with unique IDs and revision numbers, and updates create new document revisions in an append-only storage model. Regarding the CAP theorem, CouchDB is a classic AP system, prioritizing availability and partition tolerance. It's designed to always accept writes, even if a replica is disconnected from the network, with conflicts resolved later at the application level. This eventual consistency model is a deliberate trade-off, making it a great fit for messaging apps, collaboration tools, and other distributed systems where being able to write data at all times is more critical than immediate global consistency.

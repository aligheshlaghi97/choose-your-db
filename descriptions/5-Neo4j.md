Neo4j is a specialized, native graph database where data is stored in a highly interconnected structure of nodes and relationships. The relationships are first-class citizens, which makes graph traversals (hops across connections) extremely fast and efficient, avoiding the expensive JOIN operations required in relational databases.  It uses the powerful, declarative Cypher query language, which is intuitive for working with interconnected data. From a CAP theorem perspective, Neo4j is a CA system but CP when sharded. Because the entire graph structure needs to be consistent for queries to be accurate, Neo4j does not automatically shard data. It provides ACID transactions and guarantees strong consistency across its cluster, but it cannot fully guarantee availability in the event of a network partition. This makes it the premier choice for applications where relationships are the most important part of the data, such as social networks, recommendation engines, and fraud detection.
